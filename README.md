# Market Maker Project

This repository contains files for a market-making strategy. However, **only the following files are relevant to the project**:

- `custom_strategy.py`: Contains the whole trading strategy implementation.
- `glft.py`: Implements the Gu√©ant-Lehalle-Fernandez-Tapia model.
- `main_maker.py`: The script to execute the trading.
- `hyp_liq.py`: HyperLiquid API script.
- `binance_api.py`: Binance API script.

### Note
The rest of the files are completely irrelevant, but GitHub forces them here. Consider them utterly useless!
