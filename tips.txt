When getting started, only:
    * model
    * strategy 
    * latency 
should be part of the first problem class. 


Some important sounding things that I would recommend the 80/20 principle on:
1) inventory management
2) sizing
3) hedging

Starting with inventory management:

1. Query your positions periodically. 
2. Listen to fill feed or order/cancel responses. 
3. When your position changed, don't bother figuring out by how much. Instead, fade your top of book orders and don't take until you re-query.

Sounds hacky, but a low volume HFT strategy running with this system will get almost all the good volume compared to running with drop-copy and real time position reconciliation.

The volume you miss with this setup will be the more marginal fills anyway.


With market moves and hedging, just ignore it. Keep a small position limit, and bias towards flattening. 

Again, if you truly have short term alpha, your expected pnl will not suffer from this adjustment.

Compute markouts to determine if you have edge.

Once your strategy matures and you decide to productionize it, these issues slowly migrate towards things you must get "exactly right." 

But when starting out the proper implementation will bog you down and not contribute to the sign of your pnl.
